# Luxury Supply Chain Traceability - Single Brand Implementation

## Project Overview
Create a **configurable luxury supply chain traceability system** as a Proof of Concept using Hyperledger Fabric with 2-Check consensus and customer ownership tracking. The system will be demonstrated with one luxury item from your company but architected for easy adaptation to other brands.

## Strategic Approach: Practical Blockchain for Luxury Brands

### Core Philosophy
- **Business First**: Match existing business processes, don't reinvent them
- **Hidden Complexity**: Customers never know they're using blockchain
- **Practical Consensus**: 2-Check system mimics real-world shipping/receiving
- **True Ownership**: Immutable ownership records without crypto wallets
- **Simple Scaling**: Template approach for quick brand adaptation

### Technology Stack

#### Core Blockchain Platform
- **Hyperledger Fabric 2.5+** with 2-Check consensus mechanism
- **Smart Contracts** in Go for ownership and supply chain tracking
- **No Customer Nodes** - Gateway handles all customer operations
- **Fabric SDK** with modern fabric-gateway 1.x

#### Backend Services
- **Fabric Gateway** (Node.js + TypeScript) for blockchain abstraction
- **Customer API** (REST) for ownership operations
- **Service Accounts** for fee management
- **QR/NFC Integration** for physical-digital link

#### Frontend Applications
- **Next.js 15** web application for stakeholders
- **Mobile Web** for customer ownership (no app needed)
- **Admin Dashboard** for brand management
- **Simple QR Scanner** for verification

#### Development Infrastructure
- **Docker Compose** for local development
- **Configurable deployment** via templates
- **Complete monitoring** for production readiness

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Configurable Fabric Network ✅ [COMPLETED]
**Objective**: Create adaptable Hyperledger Fabric network with configuration-based setup

**What You've Built**:
- ✅ Template-based network generation
- ✅ 4 organizations (brand, supplier, manufacturer, retailer)
- ✅ Modern SDK with fabric-gateway 1.x
- ✅ Channel participation API (no system channel)
- ✅ Complete testing framework

**No Changes Needed** - Foundation is perfect for our approach

## Implementation Architecture

### Network Architecture (Phase 1 - No Changes)
```
Organizations:
├── Brand Owner (luxebags)
├── Supplier (italianleather)
├── Manufacturer (craftworkshop)
└── Retailer (luxuryretail)

Customers are NOT organizations - they interact via Gateway
```

### Consensus Flow (Phase 2)
```
B2B Transfers:
Supplier ──[confirms sent]──→ Manufacturer ──[confirms received]──→ ✓ Validated

B2C Transfers:
Retailer ──[confirms sale]──→ Customer ──[claims via web]──→ ✓ Owned
(No consensus needed - Gateway handles blockchain)
```

### Data Architecture (Phase 3)
```
On-Chain Data:
├── Product ID & Authenticity
├── Ownership (hashed identities)
├── Transfer History
├── Status Flags (stolen, etc.)
└── B2B Transaction Records

Off-Chain Data:
├── Personal Information
├── Prices
├── Detailed Images
├── Customer Preferences
└── Marketing Data
```

### API Structure (Phase 4)
```
/api/b2b/
  ├── /confirm-sent
  ├── /confirm-received
  ├── /dispute
  └── /batch-operations

/api/customer/
  ├── /claim-ownership
  ├── /transfer-item
  ├── /verify-authenticity
  ├── /report-stolen
  └── /recovery
```
